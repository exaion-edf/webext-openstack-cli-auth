 OpenStack CLI auth is a Firefox extension that will help you with the openstack
 CLI when connecting to a cloud that is using authentication methods such as OpenID

 It will obtain the authentication token from the web session and copy it in the
 userâ€™s clouds.yaml file for all clouds that have a matching authentication URL.
